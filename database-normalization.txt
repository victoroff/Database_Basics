I. Database schema normalization:
	Normalization involves decomposing a table into less redundant (and smaller) tables but without losing information;
        defining foreign keys in the old table referencing the primary keys of the new ones. 

II. Advantages of Normalized Database:
	- It opens the opportunity additions, deletions, and modifications of an attribute can be made in just one table and then propagated through
        the rest of the database using the defined foreign keys.
	- Index searching is more faster than the other search types.
	- Adaptive Server is optimized to keep higher levels of the index in cache, so each join performs only one or two physical I/Os for each matching row.
	- More tables. Plus more rows per page.
	- Fewer null values and less redundant data, making your database more compact.
