TABLE 
 What is table? 
	- A table is a collection of related data held in a structured format within a database. It consists of fields (columns), and rows.
 How information is stored in tables? 
	- A table has a specified number of columns, but can have any number of rows.The possible information that can be stored depends on the capacity of the database.
 What is the difference between tables and relations? 
	- A table can potentially contain duplicate rows, whereas a true relation cannot contain duplicate tuples. Similarly, representation as a table implies a particular ordering to the rows and columns, whereas a relation is explicitly unordered. However, the database system does not guarantee any ordering of the rows unless an ORDER BY clause is specified in the SELECT statement that queries the table.
	 An equally valid representations of a relation is as an n-dimensional chart, where n is the number of attributes (a table's columns). For example, a relation with two attributes and three values can be represented as a table with two columns and three rows, or as a two-dimensional graph with three points. The table and graph representations are only equivalent if the ordering of rows is not significant, and the table has no duplicate rows.
