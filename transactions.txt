Database Transaction

 1.Database transaction:
	- A database transaction is a unit of work, typically encapsulating
          a number of operations over a database (e.g., reading a database object,
          writing, acquiring lock, etc.), an abstraction supported in database and
          also other systems. 	
 What is ACID transaction?
	ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties
        that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably.
        In the context of databases, a single logical operation on the data is called
        a transaction. 	

 What is transaction log? 
	- Transaction log is a history of actions executed by a database management system to guarantee ACID properties over crashes or hardware failures. Physically, a log is a file listing changes to the database, stored in a stable storage format.
