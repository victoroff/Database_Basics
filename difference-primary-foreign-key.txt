Primary and foreign key 

 What is the primary key? 
	- Primary key(PK) is a unique indentifier for each record in a table. It can either be a normal attribute that is guaranteed to be unique or it can be generated by the DBMS. 
 Why do we need it?
	- We need PK to improve the database's performance by avoiding  duplicate rows. Also PK is the key that is allowed to migrate to other entities to define the relationships that exist among the entities. When the data model is instantiated into a physical database, it is the key that the system uses the most when accessing the table, or joining the tables together when selecting data.
 What is the foreign key?
	- The foreign key is defined in a second table, but it refers to the primary key in the first table.
 What is the purpose of foreign keys?
	- The purpose of the foreign key is to identify a particular row of the referenced table
 What is the difference between a primary and foreign key? 
	- The primary key identifies uniquely a record whereas the foreign key is used to link two or more tables together.
